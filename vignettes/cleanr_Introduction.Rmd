# BLAH
Check your R code for some of the most common layout flaws.

Many tried to teach us how to write code less dreadful, be it implicitly as
@KR did,
be it explicitly as
@cc
did.

So we should check our code for files too long or wide, functions with too
many lines, too wide lines, too many arguments or nestings too deep.

After loading the package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("cleanr")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library("cleanr")
set_cleanr_options(reset = TRUE)

```

we pick a file we want to check:
```{r}
file_name <- system.file("source", "R", "utils.R", package = "cleanr")

```

```{r}
# dir first
```
