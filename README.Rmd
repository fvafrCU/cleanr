# cleanr
Check your R code for some of the most common layout flaws.

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
## Introduction
Please read the [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fvafrCU/cleanr/blob/master/inst/doc/cleanr_Introduction.html)
or, after installation, the help page:

```{r, results = "hide"}
options(pager = "/bin/cat")
help("cleanr-package", package = "cleanr")
```

## Installation
You can install cleanr from github with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (! require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fvafrCU/cleanr")
```

## cleanr is a fork 
of [coldr](https://github.com/fvafrcu/coldr.git),
which was a set of shell scripts I used to check the file layout (number of 
lines, width of lines and the like) of code files and somehow turned out to be 
an R package.
