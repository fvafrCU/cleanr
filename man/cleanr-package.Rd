\title{Helps You to Code Cleaner}
\description{
Check your R code for some of the most common layout flaws.
}
\details{
Many tried to teach us how to write code less dreadful, be it implicitly as
B. W. Kernighan and D. M. Ritchie in \cite{The C Programming Language} did,
be it explicitly as
R.C. Martin in \cite{Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship}
did.

So we should check our code for files too long or wide, functions with too
many lines, too wide lines, too many arguments or too many levels of nesting.

This is not a static code analyzer like pylint or the like. If you're
looking for a static code analyzer, check out lintr
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=lintr} or
